## Investigation of the exponential distribution

### Overview
This is the result for the course project for the statistical inference course. It investigates the Exponential Distribution using R. It will compare the distribution with the Central Limit Theorem via simulation and inferential analysis.

```{r}
set.seed(2015)
lambda <- 0.2 # the rate parameter lambda as instructed
n <- 40 # number of exponentials
sim <- 1000 # a thousand simulations
```



### 1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
